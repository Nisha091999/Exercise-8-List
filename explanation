def encode_message(input_message):
This line defines a function called encode_message that takes an input_message as a parameter.


input_message = input_message.replace(" ", "")
This line removes all spaces from the input_message by replacing them with an empty string. 
The modified input_message is stored back into the variable input_message.



num_rows = 9
num_cols = (len(input_message) // num_rows) + 1
These lines define the number of rows (num_rows) and calculate the number of columns (num_cols) needed for the rectangle. 
In this code, the number of rows is set to 9, and the number of columns is calculated by dividing the length of the input_message by num_rows and adding 
1. This ensures that the rectangle can accommodate the message.


input_message += (num_rows * num_cols - len(input_message)) * " "
This line pads the input_message with extra spaces if necessary. 
It calculates the number of characters needed to fill the rectangle completely (num_rows * num_cols - len(input_message)) and 
adds that number of spaces at the end of the input_message.


rectangle = [input_message[i::num_cols] for i in range(num_cols)]
This line creates the rectangle by reading the input_message column-wise. It uses a list comprehension to generate a list of strings, 
where each string represents a column of the rectangle. The input_message[i::num_cols] slicing syntax selects every num_cols-th character starting 
from the i-th position, effectively forming the columns.


encoded_message = "\n".join(rectangle)
This line joins the strings in the rectangle list with a newline character (\n) in between, 
effectively combining the columns of the rectangle to form the encoded message.


return encoded_message
This line returns the encoded message from the encode_message function.


input_message = input("Enter the input statement: ")
This line prompts the user to enter an input statement and stores it in the input_message variable.


encoded_message = encode_message(input_message)
This line calls the encode_message function, passing the input_message as an argument, and 
stores the returned encoded message in the encoded_message variable.


print("Encoded Message:")
print(encoded_message)
These lines print a header "Encoded Message:" and the value of the encoded_message variable, 
which represents the encoded message generated by the encode_message function.
